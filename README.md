# Election Analysis
## Overview of Election Audit
Our friends Seth and Tom were overlooking the election for their hometowns and they enlisted our help to ensure votes were being tallied correctly. They had the raw data of the candidate that was voted for and the county the votes were coming from. After we helped them with a candidate summary, they wanted to use the data to summarize the county results including: the voter turnout for each county, the percentage of votes from each county out of the total count, and the county with the highest turnout. These were our results.
